        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello, I'm Sudhanshu Mishra, a passionate and creative web developer and an UI/UX designer based in Panvel. With a strong foundation in front-end I strive to create beautiful and functional websites that leave a lasting impression.
            My journey in the world of web development began from 11th standered when i created my first application using Python. Since then, I have honed my skills in HTML, CSS, Figma and UI/UX designing, and various web frameworks to bring ideas to life. I am always eager to stay updated with the latest technologies and industry trends to deliver innovative solutions.
            In addition to my technical skills, I have a keen eye for design and user experience. I believe in the power of clean, intuitive interfaces that enhance the user's journey. Collaboration and communication are at the core of my work ethic, and I enjoy taking on challenges that push me to grow both personally and professionally.
            When I'm not coding, you can find me dancing, reading stories and playing football. I am constantly seeking new opportunities to learn and contribute to exciting projects. Let's connect and build something amazing together!</p>
